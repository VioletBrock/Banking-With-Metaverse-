The application in general must be made of an interface in which the user and the
system can interact. In that case the application should be able to display or compose
the three tires. Those tires are: User Interface Services, Business Services, and Data
Services. The system that is proposed here also explains on the same. User Interface: - The user interface part of the system interacts with the user and
provide the user needs. In this part we have worked on implementing Gestures and
Motion Detection from which the Actions of the user can be observed and transactions
and processes can be made accordingly. This part as it is an interface between the user
and the system, it needs to be well attractive and innovative such that the user gets
involved much in its contents. The user interface works on the process, from user to
system and the system to the user. It is the external part that the user experience from
the system. Thus, the system is made with immersive experience along with necessary
animations to make the system more interactive and attractive. Business Services: - This part defines about the services that is to be provided by the
system in business point of view. Such as finance, transactions, products, etc. the
system we have proposed here uses the finance part in which the user will be acting
upon the banking field. Here we emphasize the process and the part that is hidden to
the user but very much necessary for the complete transaction. This part contains the
transaction execution part on the bank server. The bank server will be connected
backend. Whenever the user request for banking actions such as checking balance, sending and receiving money, paying bills, recharge and so on. For these banking action
it not only requires users’ interest but also the connectivity from the bank server on the
user’s account. In this part the security of the transaction is also a notable criterion in
which the transactions that they do must implement the proposed concepts and also
with security encryption. This part will be attached with the system itself and be
deployed for execution during the transaction process. This part basically focuses on the
connectivity that is done back end of the system. Data Services: - This part defines about the Database connectivity. That is the data that
is shared with the system is stores here. The data such as transactions, recent payments
